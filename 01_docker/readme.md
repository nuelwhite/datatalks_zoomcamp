## Docker Overview

Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### What is Docker Used For?
- **Application Deployment:** Easily deploy applications in isolated containers.
- **Environment Consistency:** Run the same container on any system that supports Docker.
- **Microservices:** Simplifies building, shipping, and running microservices architectures.
- **Testing & CI/CD:** Quickly spin up disposable environments for testing and continuous integration.

### Importance of Docker
- **Portability:** Containers run the same regardless of the host OS.
- **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, improving security and stability.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down by adding/removing containers.

### Common Docker Commands
```sh
# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t <image_name> .

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Run a container from an image
docker run -d -p 8080:80 <image_name>

# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
docker rmi <image_name>

# View Docker images
docker images

# View logs of a container
docker logs <container_id>
```

# ...existing code...

## Key Docker Concepts

### Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` is a text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment setup, dependencies, and commands to run your application. Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Docker Image
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. Images are built from Dockerfiles and can be shared via registries like Docker Hub.

### Docker Container
A container is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but can communicate through defined channels.

### Docker Volume
Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow data to survive container restarts and removals.

### Docker Network
Docker networks enable communication between containers. You can create custom networks to control how containers interact with each other and with external resources.
